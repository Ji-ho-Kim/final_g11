# Creating my own to-go restaurant list

## Brief overview

This is ossc final project of Group 11.
The name of our project is **"Creating my own to-go restaurant list"**.
By crawling data of one hundred data for each of the 25 boroughs in Seoul from _MangoPlate_(망고플레이트), Korea's trusted restaurant review site.
The crawled four items are as follows:

    1. the borough which the restaurant belongs
    2. restaurant name
    3. rating by reviewers
    4. restaurant type (Korean, Chinese, Western...)

Crawled data are stored in **Excel(.xlsx)** file.
(We excluded restaurants that don't have a rating.)

To start, when a user clicks on "파일 선택" button and select the downloaded xlsx file, a table appears in which restaurants throughout Seoul have high ratings.
To see the results categorized by region, you can simply click on the section of the map above that you want to visit.

Then, enter one of the following in the text box: "한식, 양식, 일식, 중식, 디저트" to see the results categorized by the type of restaurant.

Finally, you can add the restaurant that you want to go to the list and manage your own list.

Whenever you are wondering which restaurant to go to, visit this website and check your list! :)
